\begin{abstract}
The transverse momentum structure of the nucleon generalizes the 1-dimensional
parton distribution functions (PDFs) to the a 3-dimensional description.  The
extended distributions are called transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton
distribution functions.  TMDs functions include transverse quark and gluon
momentum to parameterize the non-perturbative description of a nucleon.  Eight
TMDs parameterize a nucleon at leading order and the Sivers TMD is unique in
that it is spin-dependent and theorized to change signs between the Drell-Yan
process and Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS).

The COMPASS spectrometer is unique in that it has the ability to study the
products from a polarized target and the beam can be modified to measure the
SIDIS and Drell-Yan processes.  The COMPASS collaboration collected transverse
spin-dependent data to measure the Sivers function from SIDIS and in 2016
COMPASS published the results of a Sivers asymmetry amplitude from the SIDIS
process.  In 2015 COMPASS collected data to study the Drell-Yan process from a
transversely polarized proton target and a 190~{\gvcw} $\pi^-$ beam.  Therefore
COMPASS has the unique ability conclude on the non-universality of the Sivers
TMD between the SIDIS and Drell-Yan processes.

This thesis presents analysis of the 2015 COMPASS Drell-Yan data taking.  The
analysis focuses on the Sivers TMD but also provides results on the tranvsersity
and pretzelosity TMD functions which are expected to be universal.  The Sivers
results presented in this thesis are consistent with a sign flip between
Drell-Yan and SIDIS.

I would like to thank my co-advisors Caroline Riedl and Matthias Grosse
Perdekamp for giving me the opportunity to learn about new and interesting
physical phenomena and as well for giving me the opportunity to learn about
different cultures.  I would like to thank Vincent Andrieux for many interesting
discussions both about physics and life in France.

I would like to think the funding agencies for make this research possible.
This work was supported by the Nation Science Foundation through the NSF PRAC
award \#1713684 and the NSF grant \#1506416.  This research was also supported
by the Blue Waters sustained-petascale computing project, which is supported by
the National Science Foundation (awards OCI-0725070 and ACI-1238993) and the
state of Illinois. Blue Waters is a joint effort of the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign and its National Center for Supercomputing Applications.

Lastly I would like to acknowledge my cat Fox Trot for being both a source
stress and an anxiety reliever.
