abstract="We investigate the cos2$\phi$ azimuthal asymmetry in Drell--Yan and J/$\psi$ production from unpolarized pp̄ scattering at GSI-HESR energies. The contribution to this asymmetry arising from the leading-twist Boer--Mulders function {\$}h{\_}1^{\{}{\backslash}perp{\}}{\$}(x,kT2), which describes a correlation between the transverse momentum and the transverse spin of quarks in an unpolarized hadron, is explicitly evaluated, and predictions for the GSI-HESR kinematic regime are presented. We show that the cos2$\phi$ asymmetry is quite sizable both on the J/$\psi$ peak and in the Drell--Yan continuum region. Therefore these processes may offer experimentally viable access to the Boer--Mulders function in the early unpolarized stage of GSI experiments. ",
