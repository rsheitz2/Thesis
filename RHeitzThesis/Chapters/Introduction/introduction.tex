Rutherford = first experiment for nuclear physics ~100yrs ago

Gell-Mann and Zweig = quark model in 1964

parton model established by Feynman in late 60s

quark and parton model are unified in 70s by Gell-Mann and Fritzsch w/ QCD


maybe spin crisis
(Internal spin structure starts in 70s  EMC effect heavily influences this interest)


1975 = transverse effects
