The COmmon Muon Proton Apparatus for Structure and Spectroscopy (COMPASS)
experiment is a fixed target experiment at located on the French side at CERN.
COMPASS started taking data in 2002 in the same hall as earlier Euopean Muon
Collaboration (EMC), New Muon Collaboration (NMC) and Spin Muon Collaboration
(SMC) experiments.  COMPASS has studied hadron structure through (SI)DIS,
Drell-Yan and Primakoff reactions and has done hadron spectroscopy measurements.
\par

The COMPASS spectrometer is a two-stage spectrometer.  The two stages are in a
series and each stage contains various tracking detectors and as well at the end
of each stage there is a muon wall filter for distinguishing between muons and
other particles.  Both stages also contain an electromagnetic and hadron
calorimeter.  Each stage is centerend around a strong spectrometer magnet used
for determining particle momentum.  The first stage downstream of the target is
the large angle spectrometer (LAS) and it is centered around the SM1 magnet
which has an integrated field of 1~Tm.  This stage detects tracks with larger
polar scattering angles roughly between 26 mrad and 160 mrad.  The second stage
is the small angle spectrometer (SAS) and it detects particle tracks having a
scattering angle between roughly 8 mrad and 45 mrad.  This stage is centered
around the SM2 magnetic which has an integrated field of 4.4~Tm.  A graphic of
the 2015 setup is shown in Fig~\ref{fig::compassSpec}.\par

This chapter gives an overview of the COMPASS data taking setup with specific
interest on the 2015 setup from which the data in this thesis was produced from.
For a more thorough review of the spectrometer see
reference~\cite{compassSpec}.  This chapter is roughly organized by how the
data taking occurs.

\section{2015 Drell-Yan Setup}


This section of the spectrometer covers high
$Q^2$ and high $x_b$.  The target-pointing trigger system in LAS consists of two
hodoscopes, one down stream of the last tracker in LAS and the other just after
an iron muon filter in front of the second spectrometer magnet.

The trigger in SAS is
similar to the LAS trigger but for muons of a lower $Q^2$ value.  The tracking
detectors used in both spectrometers are gaseous detectors (drift chambers,
straws, multi-wire proportional detectors), micro-megas, and gas electron
multiplier (GEM) detectors.  The two stages are separated by two spectrometer
magnets: SM1, with a magnetic field integral of 1~Tm and SM2, with a magnetic
field integral of 4.4~Tm~\cite{compassSpec}.

Both SM1 and SM2 have magnetic
fields in the vertical direction meaning charged particles are deflected in the
x-z plane and can therefore have their momentum determined.  For beam
reconstruction there is a beam telescope upstream of the target consisting of
eight planes of scifi detectors.  To account for the transverse magnetic field
in the polarized target a chicane magnet system was added in the beam line.
This meant that the beam entered at a slight angle in the beam telescope but
exited the target going straight. \par

\section{The Beam old}
The Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) is the second largest accelerator
at CERN.  It has a circumference of almost 7 km and it can accelerate
protons up to an energy of 450~GeV.  The SPS extracts beam to the
Large Hadron Collier and as well sends beam to various experiments in
the North Area at CERN.  COMPASS is one of these North Area
experiments, receiving beam tangent from the SPS on the M2 beam line.
In 2015 the SPS was delivering to COMPASS around $100 \times 10^{11}$
protons over a 4.9 second spill length and a spill was sent
approximately twice every 32 seconds.  The proton beam extracted from
the SPS then would collide with a primary 500~mm long, beryllium
target and from there a secondary hadron beam consisting of 97\% $\pi
^-$, 2\% $\bar{p}$ and 1\% $K^-$ was captured with magneto-optics into
a beamline leading to the COMPASS spectrometer.  The flux of the
secondary hadron beam averaged $0.6 \times 10^8
\frac{\mathrm{hadrons}}{\mathrm{sec}}$ and its momentum was
190~$\frac{\mathrm{GeV}}{\mathrm{c}}$~\cite{compassDYpaper}.

The target material used was ammonia ($\mathrm{NH}_3$), where the proton from
the hydrogen nucleus was the polarizable nucleon.  The average polarization
throughout the data taking was 0.73 and a 0.6~T dipole magnet was used to
maintain target polarization.  With this dipole field and polarization, the spin
relaxation time for the target was approximately 1000 hours.  The target was
separated into two 55~cm cells of radius 2~cm which were in turn separated by
20~cm and oppositely polarized, as shown in figure~\ref{fig::Absorber}.  In 2015,
COMPASS took nine data periods labeled W07-W15.  Each data period lasted two
weeks and the spin orientation of the targets was reversed after the first week
of every period to reduce systematic effects arising from different geometric
acceptances and luminosities of up and downstream target cells.
%Most notably the spin
%orientation was reversed to have equal luminosity and to force equal
%geometrical acceptance between the two spin states. \par

For the 2015 Drell-Yan data taking a hadron absorber,
see figure~\ref{fig::Absorber}, was placed just downstream of the target
cells.  This was done to reduce the amount of hadrons and electrons
detected in the spectrometer and therefore ensured a cleaner di-muon
sample.  The absorber material was mostly alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$) and
concrete and the absorber corresponded to approximately 7.5
interactions lengths of material.  Inside the absorber was an aluminum
target followed by a tungsten plug, each of radius 2.5 cm, which acted
as a beam dump.  The aluminum target and tungsten plug served the
double purposes as absorbers and also as unpolarized nuclear targets.
In addition a thin $^6\mathrm{Li}$ absorber was added just downstream of the
primary absorber to absorb thermal neutrons produced in the primary
absorber.  This $^6\mathrm{Li}$ absorber was proposed to improve the
performance of the first tracking detector downstream of the
target. \par

\subsection{DAQ and Reconstruction}
The data acquisition system (DAQ) was recording events at a rate of
approximately 30~kHz with a dead time of 10\%.  In 2015, COMPASS
recorded approximately 750~terabytes of raw data from the nine,
two-week periods.  Raw data refers solely to individual detector
timing and wire or strip positions and does not correspond to physics
observables of interest.  From this raw information the CORAL
reconstruction software at COMPASS is able to determine the trajectory
and momentum of charged particles going through the COMPASS
spectrometer.

%This reconstruction stage reduces the data volume by approximately a factor of 10.
